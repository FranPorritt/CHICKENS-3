// NOTES //

-- Crops --
* Need to adjust growth rate - too fast currently

-- Chickens --
* mapExtent within fenced area when gate closed
* mapExtent whole map when gate open
* Need to add gate check in Wandering() - if set position prior to gate closing, chicken will try get back in.


** YOU ARE HERE **
- Chicken will leave feeder once it's full but not when the feeder is empty
- Open gate is causing a lot of issues. Chickens try run through it a lot. If they want food, are outside and the gate is shut they should just wait outside it?
