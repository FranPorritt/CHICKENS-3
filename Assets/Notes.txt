FIND CLOSEST ENEMY - https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.html
Could be used for foxes to find closest chicken!


** YOU ARE HERE ** - Last Update: 24-09-2020
- Open gate is causing issues. Chickens try run through it a lot. If they want food, are outside and the gate is shut they should just wait outside it?
- Foxes leave after eating chicken but if the chicken chases them they will then become idle once clear of player and will then eat another chicken before leaving.

** TO DO ** - 12-09-2020
- Foxes can come in through gate
- Fix chickens trying to get out closed gate
