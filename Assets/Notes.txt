FIND CLOSEST ENEMY - https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.html
Could be used for foxes to find closest chicken!


** YOU ARE HERE ** - Last Update: 12-09-2020
- Chickens all seem to be trying to leave via the gate even tho it's shut. Check fencedArea stuff and make sure it's running the right code. Also all
seem to be heading to roughly same pos, want more variation.
- Open gate is causing issues. Chickens try run through it a lot. If they want food, are outside and the gate is shut they should just wait outside it?

** TO DO ** - 12-09-2020
- Foxes can come in through gate
- Fix chickens trying to get out closed gate
