// NOTES //

-- Crops --
* Need to adjust growth rate - too fast currently

-- Chickens --
* mapExtent within fenced area when gate closed
* mapExtent whole map when gate open
* Need to add gate check in Wandering() - if set position prior to gate closing, chicken will try get back in.

- Chickens now lay eggs and a pop up tells the player they're ready to be collected.
- After becoming full once and visiting a coop, chickens won't come back to eat from the feeder again. Is full not being set to false? is their hunger not going back down?
- Open gate is causing issues. Chickens try run through it a lot. If they want food, are outside and the gate is shut they should just wait outside it?
