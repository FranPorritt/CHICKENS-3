// NOTES //

-- Crops --
* Need to adjust growth rate - too fast currently

-- Chickens --
* mapExtent within fenced area when gate closed
* mapExtent whole map when gate open
* Need to add gate check in Wandering() - if set position prior to gate closing, chicken will try get back in.

Could be used for foxes to find closest chicken!


** YOU ARE HERE ** - Last Update: 10-09-2020
- Issue with fox. Won't teleport between holes, will teleport to 0,0,0 when controlled by key press but still breaks when on collision.
- Fox just will not teleport within the fencedArea ?????????????????????? >:(
- Fox issue with hunt/flee. Think it's getting stuck on hasTarget, just moves back and forth. Maybe something to with the OnTrigger stuff???
- Open gate is causing issues. Chickens try run through it a lot. If they want food, are outside and the gate is shut they should just wait outside it?

** TO DO ** - 04-09-2020
- Chicken fleeing from everything except other chickens
- Foxes can come in through gate
